GL_TEXTURE_MIN_LOD
Sets the minimum level-of-detail parameter. This floating-point value limits the selection of highest resolution mipmap (lowest mipmap level). The initial value is -1000.

GL_TEXTURE_MAX_LOD
Sets the maximum level-of-detail parameter. This floating-point value limits the selection of the lowest resolution mipmap (highest mipmap level). The initial value is 1000.

GL_TEXTURE_MAX_LEVEL
